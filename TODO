* Handle pagination through the APIListHelper class intelligentaly
  - hold the list we have so far in the class
  - request new data only as needed for __getitem__, find, next, etc...

* Implement proper exception classes across the board

* A Database.connect method to return a MySQLdb Connection class instance to the cloud database
  - probably have to take in the password as an argument since the API doesn't expose that
